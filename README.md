# Classification_Dallas_Shootings
Mid bootcamp project for data analytics course at Ironhack using the "On-Duty Officer Involved Shootings Data" from the Dallas Police Department for a classification case study.

## Background
This case study is the mid term project of my Ironhack Data Analytics Bootcamp. Since the small project in this bootcamp involved a linear regression model, I settled on working on a classification model.

## Scenario
Imagine I would be working with the Dallas Police Department to help to improve the safety of the officers and the citizens of Dallas. Reducing fatal incidences (of subjects) might be possible if the conditions leading to such fatal incidences could be narrowed down and avoided.

## Objectives
Create a classification model to predict the outcome of a shooting incidence using the available data on officers, subjects and incidence.
Figure out the relevant triggers that have a high probability to result in fatal shootings.

## Limitations
This model is restricted by the information in the database and limited amount of cases (219). For instance there is little information in the database about the officers, their years of experience as a cop, there shooting abilities, their training etc. Even though the pdf summaries of the incidences are providing some more information, the two week period of the project will probably not allow enough time to read through all cases and add the relevant information to the database. The same holds true for information on the subjects and information on the incidences itself.
